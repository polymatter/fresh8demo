# Fresh 8

This project is a demo of a fullstack app.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` 

Runs the frontend. Built from create react app and uses port 3000.

### `npm run backend`

Runs the fake backend. This is an Express server that merely serves the sample data listening on port 4000. Although it could use the static middleware, I wanted to demonstrate how it would work if we were to do something more dynamic.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in watch mode.
